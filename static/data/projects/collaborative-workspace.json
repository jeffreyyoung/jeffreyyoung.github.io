AW is product that users can use to create dashboards to view web traffic analytics.  One problem with Analysis Workspace is that only one user can edit a dashboard at a time.  If multiple users, logged in on different computers, edit the same dashboard, each user will be overriding the other users changes.</p>\n<p>To address this problem, I decided I wanted to make Analysis Workspace like Google Docs, where when one user edits a dashboard, changes are pushed to all other users viewing the same dashboard. I posted the idea to the garageweek idea list and two coworkers decided to work with me.  At the end of garage week we were selected as 1 of 8 finalists, and additionally months later we got to demo our project to the CEO of adobe.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"ma0\"><noscript><img src=\"/static/images/instagram.jpg\" alt=\"Demoing the Project to the CEO\"/></noscript><img class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"undefined\" src=\"/static/images/instagram.jpg\" alt=\"Demoing the Project to the CEO\"/></figure></p>\n<h3>Technology Used</h3>\n<p>We create a node server with socket.io to send messages back and forth between users.</p>\n<p>Since Analysis Workspace already records project changes for undo/redo functionality, we leveraged already written functionality to broadcast and replay changes.</p>\n","meta":{"title":"Adobe Hackathon Finalist","image":"/static/images/collaboration-demo.gif","imageDescription":"Demo of Analysis Workspace with Collaboration","category":"projects","order":3,"description":"What I built to be a finalist of a Adobe Analytics Hackathon","competition":true}},"nextProject":{"title":"Adobe Hackathon Finalist","image":"/static/images/collaboration-demo.gif","imageDescription":"Demo of Analysis Workspace with Collaboration","description":"What I built to be a finalist of a Adobe Analytics Hackathon","url":"/projects/collaborative-workspace"}}
